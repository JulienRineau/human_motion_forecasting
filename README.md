# Human Motion Forecasting for Dynamic Human Robot Collaboration
A Neural Network based method for Human Motion Forecasting in the context of Dynamic Human-Robot Collaboration. The network architecture relies on Separable Space-Time Graph Convolutional Network and Self-Attention Layers. Some of the code was adapted from HisRepsItself by Wei Mao and STSGCN by FraLuca.
