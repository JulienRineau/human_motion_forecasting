# Human Motion Forecasting for Dynamic Human Robot Collaboration
A Neural Network based method for Human Motion Forecasting in the context of Dynamic Human-Robot Collaboration. The network architecture relies on Graph Convolutional Network and Self-Attention Layers. This code is the implementation of a project that I have worked on for the [Barton Research Group](https://brg.engin.umich.edu/research/robotic-smart-manufacturing). Some of the code was adapted from HisRepsItself by Wei Mao.
